Note that module-info.java in the calc module no longer requires the
math and loan modules. Instead, it uses ServiceLoader to load the
classes.

Additionally, when we create the custom image, we need to be explicit in
adding the math and loan modules since weâ€™re no longer directly
dependent upon them from within the calc module. In the previous
example, the module-info.java for calc referenced those two modules.

Because of this, we no longer need Resource.properties.

NOTE: Here, the compile time dependencies have been eliminated and we
can build these modules independently.


Steps
1.) ./build.sh
2.) ./package.sh
3.) ./run.sh
4.) Go delete math.jar
